 Statistical Lineup and Game Generated Evaluation for Runs

This program is made to predict the number of runs a team will score in today's MLB game. The model uses statistics from 2020 and onward and automatically updates after each day. The chosen algorithm for the model is a Random Forest, as I saw the highest mean squared error and r2 scores from this algorithm.
